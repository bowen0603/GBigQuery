/**
 * Key steps to set up:
 * 1. Install client library: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/libraries#client-libraries-install-java
 * 2. Create the project with maven repository with needed libraries
 * 3. Install and authenticate Google Cloud SDK: gcloud beta auth application-default login
 * 4. Import proper libraries to Intellij
 *
 * Basic tasks needed:
 * 1. Execute queries, and read into a permanent tableã€‚
 * 2. Be able to wait until the end of one job, then continue another one. (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/querying-data#asyncqueries)
 *
 *
 * Problem: two sets of APIs??? which one to use???
 * 1. com.google.cloud.bigquery
 * 2. com.google.api.services.bigquery
 *
 * TODO to watch out when writing the code:
 * 1. add an extra space at the end of a statement for the query validation.
 * 2. add the month unit for the table of each table to create separate table sets.
